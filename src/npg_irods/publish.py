    """Publish a directory and its contents to iRODS.

    Args:
        src: The local source directory path to publish.
        dest: The remote iRODS collection path to publish into. This collection must
            exist; the contents of the source directory will be published into it.
        avus: A list of AVU objects to add to each of the published root collection. The
            default is None, meaning no AVUs are added.
        acl: A list of AC objects to add to each of the published items. The default is
            None, meaning no ACL is added.
        filter_fn: A filter function to apply to each item in the source directory. The
            function should take a single argument (the item) and return True if the
            item should be filtered out, or False if it should be included. The default
            is None, meaning no items are filtered.
        local_checksum: A callable that returns a checksum for a local file. Optional,
            if None, each local file's MD5 checksum will be calculated. If local files
            are large, it may improve the publishing time to use this argument to
            supply pre-caculated checksums. The callable should take a single argument
            (the file path) and return the checksum as a string.
        fill: Fill in missing data objects in iRODS. If a data object already
            exists, the operation is skipped for that path. See DataObject.put() for
            more information. The default is False.
        force: If a data object is written, overwrite any data object already present
            in iRODS. The default is True.
        handle_exceptions: Report a count of any errors encountered during publishing,
            rather than raising an exception. The default is True. If False and one or
            more errors are encountered, a PublishingError is raised from the first
            error encountered.
        num_clients: Number of iRODS clients to use for the operation. The default is 1.
        timeout: Operation timeout in seconds.
        tries: Number of times to try the operation.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the number of items processed, the number of items
        successfully published, and the number of errors encountered.
