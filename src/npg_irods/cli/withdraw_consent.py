description = """
Reads iRODS data object paths from a file or STDIN, one per line and ensures that each
one is in a state consistent with sample consent being withdrawn.

The conditions for data objects to be in the correct state for having had consent
withdrawn are: 

 - The data object has the correct metadata. Either:
     - sample_consent = 0 (data managed by the GAPI codebase)
     - sample_consent_withdrawn = 1 (data managed by the NPG codebase)

 - Read permission for any SequenceScape study iRODS groups (named ss_<Study ID>)
   absent.

If any of the paths could not have consent withdrawn, the exit code will be non-zero
and an error message summarising the results will be sent to STDERR.
