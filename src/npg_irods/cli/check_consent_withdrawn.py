description = """
Reads iRODS data object paths from a file or STDIN, one per line and checks that each
one is in a state consistent with sample consent being withdrawn.

The conditions for data objects to be in the correct state for having had consent
withdrawn are: 

 - The data object has the correct metadata. Either:
     - sample_consent = 0 (data managed by the GAPI codebase)
     - sample_consent_withdrawn = 1 (data managed by the NPG codebase)

 - Read permission for any SequenceScape study iRODS groups (named ss_<Study ID>)
   absent.

N.B. having this consent withdrawn state is only the first step in handling consent
removal. Subsequent steps, including redaction of data within data objects are not
handled.

This script will never change any values. To withdraw consent, use the --print-fail
option to print failed paths to STDOUT and pipe them to the `withdraw-consent` script
included in this package.

If any of the paths fail their check, the exit code will be non-zero and an error
message summarising the results will be sent to STDERR.
